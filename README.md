# Restaurant Reservation UI in SwiftUI

This project is a part of a course where we explored SwiftUI and built a Restaurant Reservation User Interface. While the core concepts and instructions were provided through course videos, the UI for the reservation process was entirely designed by the students. This project served as a great learning experience, allowing us to apply SwiftUI knowledge, utilize property wrappers, stack views, and master frame manipulation.

## Features

- **User-friendly Reservation:** A visually appealing and intuitive UI for making restaurant reservations.
- **SwiftUI Implementation:** Utilizes SwiftUI to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **Property Wrappers:** Demonstrates the use of SwiftUI property wrappers for data binding and state management.
- **Layout Control:** Leveraged frame manipulation and stacking views to achieve a polished and responsive design.

## Getting Started

To get a glimpse of this Restaurant Reservation UI project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the project in Xcode.

3. Explore the SwiftUI code for the reservation interface in the `ReservationView.swift` file. This is where the magic happens!

4. Feel free to run the app in the iOS Simulator or on a physical iOS device to see the reservation UI in action.

## Requirements

- Xcode 12.0 or later
- SwiftUI knowledge (helpful but not required)
- iOS 13.0 or later

## Learning Experience

This project was an integral part of our journey to master SwiftUI. By designing the reservation UI from scratch, we gained practical experience in creating visually appealing and functional interfaces. It deepened our understanding of SwiftUI's property wrappers and layout control using frames.

## Acknowledgments

We'd like to express our gratitude to the course instructors at Meta for providing valuable guidance and resources throughout the SwiftUI learning process. This project showcases our dedication to improving our SwiftUI skills and is just the beginning of our journey into app development.
